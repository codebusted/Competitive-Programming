number of digits in a number N = floor(log10(N) + 1)

AP
nth term = a + (n-1)*d
sum of first n terms, Sn = n/2[2*a + (n-1)*d]

GP
nth term = a1 * pow(r, n-1)
sum of first n terms = a*(pow(r, n) - 1) / r-1

Median
ODD
Median = {(N+1)/2}th value.
EVEN
Median  =  Average of (N/2)th and {(N/2) + 1}th value.

PRIME NUMBER
SIEVE OF ERATOSTHENES
most efficient way  of generating prime numbers upto a given number N

FACTORIAL
TRAILING ZEROS PROBLEM

LCM and HCF
LCM (LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE)
The product of highest power of the prime numbers that appear in the prime factorization of any of the numbers gives us the LCM.
HCF/GCD (HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR/ GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR)
The product of the minimum powers of common prime terms in both of the prime factorization gives the HCF
EFFICIENT METHOD: using EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM

PERMUTATION
nPr = n!/(n - r)!
PERMUTATION WITH DUPLICATES
N! / (p1! * p2! *....*pk!)

COMBINATION
nCr = n! / [ (r!) * (n - r)! ]

MODULAR ARITHEMATICS
(a + b) mod M = ((a mod M) + (b mod M)) mod M.
(a - b) mod M = ((a mod M) - (b mod M)) mod M.
(a * b) mod M = ((a mod M) * (b mod M)) mod M.
MODULAR INVERSE
 a x â‰¡ 1 (mod M) {(a*x) % M = 1}
> x should be in {0, 1, 2, ... M-1}
> The multiplicative inverse of "a modulo M" exists if and only if a and M are relatively prime (i.e., if gcd(a, M) = 1).
 Methods of finding Modular Inverse
 1. EXTENDED EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM (used when a and m are coprime)
 2. FERMAT LITTLE THEOREM (used when m is prime)
