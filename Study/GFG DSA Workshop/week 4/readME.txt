PROPERTIES

set
> unique
> sorted order
> The value of the element cannot be modified once it is added to the set, though it is possible to remove and add the modified value of that element.
> implemented as BALANCED TREE STRUCTURE
> time complexity-> O(logn)

unordered_set
> unique
> unsorted
> time complexity-> O(n)
> elements are stored in BUCKETS using HASH TABLE

unordered_map
> when a key is inserted, initial value of it is initialized as zero if not specified otherwise

> sorting is not possible in unordered_map
