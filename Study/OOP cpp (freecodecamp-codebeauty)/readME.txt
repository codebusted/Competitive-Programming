OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
OOP is a programming paradigm. It is a set of rules that is used to solve specific type of problems.

The idea behind OOP is we represent real-life entities and their attributes/characteristics and behaviours and explain it to our computer.

INTRODUCTION
CLASSES AND OBJECTS

ACCESS MODIFIERS
three:
(1) private: only accessible within the class
(2) public: accessible anywhere in the program
(3) protected: protected is between private and public. It follows certain rules to be accessed.

> by default everything inside a class (attributes or methods) is private.

CONSTRUCTORS

PRINCIPLES OF OOP
1. ENCAPSULATION
It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit

> It is often used to prevent anyone or anything outside of the class to directly access or modify data of the class.

>getters and setters

2. ABSTRACTION
abstraction in OOP is a concept of hiding of complexity from the user.

>Virtual function: A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.

3. INHERITANCE
base class/ super class/ parent class
derived class/ child class

4. POLYMORPHISM
poly- many
morph- forms

> operator overloading
  function overloading

> polymorphism is used when parent class refrence is used to refer to a child class object
