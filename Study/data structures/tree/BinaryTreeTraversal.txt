Tree Traversal: Visiting each node in the tree exactly once in some order
-visiting -> reading or processing

Tree Traversal techniques-
(i) Breadth-first
	level-order traversal: level by level from left to right

(ii) Depth-first
In Depth-first approach, for any node,all sub-nodes are visited before visiting other node
	preorder: <root><left><right>
	inorder: <left><root><right>
	postorder: <left><right><root>

> inorder traversal of binary search tree gives sorted list.
