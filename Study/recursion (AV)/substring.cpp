/*
1). substring 2). subsequence 3). subset
example string- "abc"
substring - continuous part of a string
eg. "", a, b, c, ab, bc, abc
subsequence - discontinuity is allowed but order is maintained
eg. substring + ac; (ca is not allowed)
subset - order is not needed to be maintained
eg. subsequence + ca + ba + cb + cab + cba

note- powerset is equivalent subset


note- In all 3 cases of subset, powerset and subsequence, subset is printed.
